in a graveyard
in a haunted house
during a flash flood
in North Korea
during a commercial break
live on stage
during a dream where you have a school assignment but you forgot to do it
during a dream where all your teeth fall out
while your father played golf
in a hurricane
in a hurricane-PIKE
in a submarine
underwater
after an alien embryo killed megadeth live on stage and your father came on the egg
360 degrees the wrong way
this way
a scrub
watching Family Guy
in a society
a gamer
inside of an evil painting
in a dream (but who is the dreamer)
outside
in a hospital delivered by doctors but your mother had no health insurance
during a trapeze act
in a circus
during a Cirque du Soleil performance
pretty much normal but your dad is Dumbo
inside of a cooking pot
with a fear of jelly-beans
during an exorcism
to die world is a fuck 420069133700 dead cops
with Connor Hollis as your father
wanting to write stupid spooky programs
with ears as eyes and eyes as knees
in le wrong generation
a huge k-pop fan
already scared
spooked
with handitis
with boneitis
on the third rung of the ladder for a twelve foot high dive
in Transylvania
in the Overlook Hotel
in Amityville
in a very complicated hedge maze
in a amusement park
in six flags over Texas but there are seven flags
in Bikini Bottom
in Rock Bottom
in denial
in the USS Enterprise
IN THE USA
during a teleporter accident
in a party in the US of A
in the Jason Bourne universe
Jason
to be wild
